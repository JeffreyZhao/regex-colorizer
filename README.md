Regex Colorizer
===============

Do you want [RegexPal](http://regexpal.com/)-style regex syntax highlighting on your webpages? This library takes care of it for you, so you can spend more time writing powerful regular expressions and less time deciphering them. Currently, JavaScript is the only supported regex flavor. Any regex features not supported by JavaScript are marked as errors, along with some edge cases that cause cross-browser grief.

See [Regex Colorizer's website](http://stevenlevithan.com/regex/colorizer/) for usage examples and more details.
